Use Google Sheets as a multi-user database
This program uses the Google Apps Script API and a custom HTML interface to send messages between Google users.
It could be used as a database for many types of web apps.
Steps for implementation:
1. Create a Google Sheet
2. Replace the parts of the code labeled "identification" with the id from your google sheet. 
  ex: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/google id is here/edit
3. Publish your web application
